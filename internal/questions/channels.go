Challenge: Channel Communication

Problem: Implement a number processor that:
1. Generates numbers from 1 to n in one goroutine
2. Squares the numbers in a second goroutine
3. Prints results in the main goroutine
4. Implements graceful shutdown

Requirements:
- Use channels for communication
- Handle channel closing properly
- Implement timeout mechanism

func ProcessNumbers(n int, timeout time.Duration) error {
    return nil // Placeholder
}
