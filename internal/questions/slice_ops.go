Challenge 0.4: Slice Operations

Problem: Implement a function that performs the following operations on a slice of integers:
1. Remove all duplicates while preserving order
2. Remove all numbers that appear more than N times
3. Return the modified slice and a map of removed numbers with their counts

Example:
Input: []int{1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6}, maxOccurrences: 2
Output: []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, map[int]int{2: 3}  // 2 appeared 3 times
*/

func CleanupSlice(numbers []int, maxOccurrences int) ([]int, map[int]int) {
    return nil, nil // Placeholder
}
